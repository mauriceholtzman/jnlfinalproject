  <p> State lawmakers announced on Thursday that an estimated 81% of New York school children will be eligible to receive free breakfast and lunch in the upcoming 2023-24 school year due to combined state and federal aid for food programs. The newly passed state budget includes $134 million for meals, which will help supplement the expiration of some federal aid according to Democratic lawmakers. <br> <br> The money involved here is an investment to increase participation in the federal <a href= https://www.fns.usda.gov/cn/community-eligibility-provision> Community Eligibility Provision (CEP)</a>. This state funding removes barriers for certain schools to participate in CEP, a federal program that allows high-poverty schools to serve free breakfast and lunch to all students without requiring families to fill out applications for free or half-price meals. <a href= https://twitter.com/jpinogoodspeed?lang=en>Jessica Pino-Goodspeed</a>, a manager of School Meals Policy and Engagement at <a href=https://hungersolutionsny.org>Hunger Solutions New York</a>, said that the state budget including millions to fully fund schools eligible for CEP the "biggest recent accomplishment in providing free and reduced meals to students in New York State". <br> <br> This recent estimate of 81% of students being impacted is a strong jump from the percentage of students that were assisted with meals in 2020-21: that number came out to 49%. Consistent progress has been made since the Kid's Well-being Inidcator's Clearinghouse started tracking data in 2006, as illustrated on the graphics below. </p>

  <p> In the average New York county in 2006-07, 36% of students were given free or reduced lunch. This number has improved by thirteen percent in the fourteen years in which this data has been tracked. <br> <br> One important place of emphasis for these programs are New York City, an area that has many residents in poverty attending their public schools. The Bronx, for example, is the poorest county in New York state. The number of students assisted in the Bronx county improved from 82% to 88% from 2006 to 2021. But free meals aren't only important for the most poverty-stricken areas - there are kids in every county and district who need assistance. It's even harder to provide aid in areas where most kids are financially stable. For example, a suburban area where the median household is 23% above the state median - Saratoga County. As only 26% of kids were assisted with lunch in 2020-21, it would be hard not to feel singled out. <br> <br> Pino-Goodspeed, who has been working with Hunger Solutions New York for nearly twelve years, says that the biggest issue in providing free and reduced meals to students is a stigma around the program. She says that "it's percieved as a program for low-income students, so many childreen choose not to eat despite their hunger." Even the youngest of students have a conception of the world where they should feel ashamed to be accepting free lunch from schools, and might feel singled out as "poor" by their classmates if they recieve meals from these programs. This is a problem that advocates believe that universal free lunch could solve - eliminating the financial stipulatons and feeding all children for free. </p>

  <p> Even with the expansion of the CEP program, Pino-Goodspeed makes it clear that there are still hundreds of thousands of students in school districts around New York state that don't qualify. Advocates are calling for universal free school meals. If implemented, this would be a program that provides free meals to all students, disregarding the factors of their family's income or financial situation. "Our organization is pushing for state policy to ensure every child, regardless of the school they attend, has access to free school meals", Pino-Goodspeed said. </p>

  <p> The biggest issue yet to be fixed in school-provided meals is a nationwide problem, not one that plagues only New York. As shown above, there has been a lot of positive progress made in expanding the scope of students involved in the free or reduced meal program in the last two decades. However, what schools are serving these students leaves something to be desired. <br> <br> Even after the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/Child_Nutrition_Fact_Sheet_12_10_10.pdf"> Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA)</a> was passed in 2010, the average school lunch is extremely unbalanced. Most schools offer limited options for lunch, often serving the same types of food every day. These lunches are often high in calories, fat, and sugar, which can contribute to obesity and other health problems. Another major issue is the lack of fruit and vegetables provided to students, as most school lunches serve starchy sides like french fries or tater tots along with the often-processed entrée. <br> <br> As advocates continue to say there is more work to do, there has been a growing awareness over recent years of the importance of the importance of healthy eating habits in children's development and a recogition of the role that school lunches can play in promoting those habits. <a href= https://www.fns.usda.gov/cn/nutrition-standards-school-meals> Federal guidelines</a> established by the United States Department of Agriculture have required all schools participating in the National School Lunch Program to serve more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Many schools are also participating in farm-to-school programs, allowing schools to purchase fresh, locally grown produce from farmers. <br> <br> Pino-Goodspeed believes that it's her role "to understand what barriers are at the local, state and federal level and advocate for changes to policy and systems to improve access to the nutrition children need to grow, learn, and be healthy." She encourages you to advocate as well - every child deserves the chance to eat healthy meals throughout their school day. </p>
